# Week 3: Conditionals

## Overview
In Week 3, the emphasis was on understanding and implementing conditionals. Through a series of diverse challenges, the power of decision-making in code was explored, allowing for dynamic outcomes based on specific conditions.

## Task 1: camelCase
- **Description**: Convert a variable name from camel case to snake case. For instance, `firstName` should be converted to `first_name`.
  
## Task 2: Coke Machine
- **Description**: Simulate a vending machine that sells bottles of Coca-Cola for 50 cents. The machine only accepts coins in denominations of 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents. The program should guide the user through the process of inserting coins and inform them of the remaining amount due.

## Task 3: Just setting up my twttr
- **Description**: Implement a text shortener by omitting vowels from a given string. For example, "Twitter" would be shortened to "Twttr".

## Task 4: Vanity Plates
- **Description**: Validate a user-inputted vanity license plate based on specific requirements, such as starting with at least two letters and having a maximum of 6 characters. The program should determine if the input is valid or invalid based on the given rules.

## Task 5: Nutrition Facts
- **Description**: Provide nutrition information for various fruits. The user inputs the name of a fruit, and the program outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, based on data from the FDA.

## Reflection
Week 3 introduced the concept of conditionals, a fundamental aspect of programming. Through diverse challenges, from string manipulations to simulating real-world scenarios like a vending machine, the power and necessity of decision-making in code were evident. Each task provided a unique opportunity to apply and solidify understanding of conditionals.
