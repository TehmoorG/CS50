# Week 8: Regular Expressions

## Overview
This week's topic is Regular Expressions, a powerful tool for text processing. The tasks involve validating IP addresses, extracting YouTube URLs, converting time formats, counting specific words, and email validation.

## Task 1: NUMB3RS
**Description**:  
The task involves writing a Python function to validate IPv4 addresses.

**Usage**:  
Run the script and input an IPv4 address when prompted. The script will return whether the address is valid or not.

## Task 2: Watch on YouTube
**Description**:  
This task requires extracting YouTube URLs from HTML content and converting them to a shorter, shareable format.

**Usage**:  
Run the script and input the HTML content when prompted. The script will return the shortened YouTube URL.

## Task 3: Working 9 to 5
**Description**:  
The task involves converting time from a 12-hour format to a 24-hour format.

**Usage**:  
Run the script and input the time in 12-hour format when prompted. The script will return the time in 24-hour format.

## Task 4: Regular, um, Expressions
**Description**:  
This task involves counting the number of times the word "um" appears in a given text.

**Usage**:  
Run the script and input the text when prompted. The script will return the count of the word "um".

## Task 5: Response Validation
**Description**:  
The task involves validating email addresses.

**Usage**:  
Run the script and input an email address when prompted. The script will return whether the email address is valid or not.

## Reflection
This week was quite challenging but rewarding. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful for text manipulation. I learned how to validate IP addresses, extract URLs, and even convert time formats. It was interesting to see how a single line of code could perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple lines. I'm looking forward to applying these skills in future projects.
