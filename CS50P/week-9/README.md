# Week 9: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview

Week 9 delves into the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a foundational concept in many modern programming languages. OOP allows developers to create objects that can interact with one another, encapsulating data for cleanliness and reusability. This week's tasks challenge you to think in terms of classes and objects, pushing you to design and implement systems that are modular and scalable. From calculating one's age in minutes to managing a virtual cookie jar and designing a personalized shirtificate, you'll apply OOP principles to solve a variety of problems.

## Task 1: Seasons of Love
**Description:**  
Implement a program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and then prints how old they are in minutes, using English words instead of numerals, just like the song from Rent.

**Usage:**  
`python seasons.py`

## Task 2: Cookie Jar
**Description:**  
Implement a cookie jar in which to store cookies. The jar should have methods to deposit, withdraw, check capacity, and size.

**Usage:**  
To be used as a module or class instantiation in Python.

## Task 3: CS50 Shirtificate
**Description:**  
Implement a program that prompts the user for their name and outputs a CS50 shirtificate in a PDF format with the user's name on it.

**Usage:**  
`python shirtificate.py`

## Reflection

Week 9 introduced the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing code. The tasks provided a hands-on approach to understanding the principles of OOP. 

In "Seasons of Love", the challenge was to calculate the age in minutes based on the date of birth. This required understanding of the datetime module and its functionalities. 

"Cookie Jar" was a classic exercise in class creation, understanding instance variables, and methods. It emphasized the importance of encapsulation, one of the four pillars of OOP.

Lastly, "CS50 Shirtificate" combined the skills from previous weeks with OOP. Using the fpdf2 library to generate a PDF was a new and interesting challenge. It showcased the power of libraries and how they can be integrated into our programs.

Overall, this week solidified the understanding of OOP and its importance in structuring larger and more complex programs.
