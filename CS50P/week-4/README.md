# Week 4: Loops

## Overview
Week 4 delved into the concept of loops, a fundamental programming construct that allows for repetitive execution of code based on specific conditions. Through a series of real-world-inspired challenges, the power and versatility of loops were explored.

## Task 1: Fuel Gauge
- **Description**: Convert a given fraction (X/Y) into a percentage to represent fuel in a tank. Special indicators are used for near-empty (E) and near-full (F) tanks.

## Task 2: Felipe’s Taqueria
- **Description**: Simulate a menu ordering system for Felipe’s Taqueria. Users can add items to their order, and the program keeps a running total of the cost. The menu items and their respective prices are predefined.

## Task 3: Grocery List
- **Description**: Create a grocery list by allowing users to input items. The final list is displayed in uppercase, sorted alphabetically, and prefixed with the number of times each item was added.

## Task 4: Outdated
- **Description**: Convert a date given in the month-day-year format (common in the U.S.) to the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DD). The program handles both numeric and full month name inputs.

## Reflection
Week 4 introduced the concept of loops, allowing for repetitive tasks and operations. This week's challenges ranged from simple data conversions (like the date and fuel gauge tasks) to more complex operations like menu ordering and list creation. Each task provided a unique opportunity to apply loops in different contexts, showcasing their versatility in solving real-world problems.
