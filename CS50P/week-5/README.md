# Week 5: Libraries

## Overview
Week 5 delved into the use of libraries in Python. Libraries are collections of pre-written code that can be reused in different programs. This week's tasks leveraged various libraries to achieve diverse functionalities, from text transformation to fetching data from the web.

## Task 1: Emojize
- **Description**: Convert English text into its "emojized" version by replacing specific codes or aliases with their corresponding emoji.

## Task 2: Frank, Ian and Glenâ€™s Letters
- **Description**: Use the `pyfiglet` library to convert input text into ASCII art. The program supports various fonts and allows users to specify their desired font via command-line arguments.

## Task 3: Adieu, Adieu
- **Description**: Bid adieu to a list of names. The program formats the farewell message based on the number of names provided.

## Task 4: Guessing Game
- **Description**: A classic number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program provides hints like "Too small!" or "Too large!" based on the user's guesses.

## Task 5: Little Professor
- **Description**: Simulate the "Little Professor" toy, which generates math problems for the user to solve. The program tracks the user's score and provides feedback on incorrect answers.

## Task 6: Bitcoin Price Index
- **Description**: Using the `requests` library, fetch the current Bitcoin price from the CoinDesk API and calculate the cost of a specified number of Bitcoins in USD.

## Reflection
Week 5 showcased the power and convenience of libraries in Python. By leveraging pre-existing libraries, complex functionalities could be implemented with ease. The tasks provided hands-on experience with various libraries, emphasizing their importance in efficient and effective programming.
