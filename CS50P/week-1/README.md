# Week 1: Introduction to Python

## Overview
Week 1 dives into the basics of Python programming, exploring string manipulations, user input, and basic arithmetic operations. Through a series of tasks, the foundational concepts of Python are introduced and applied.

## Task 1: Indoor Voice
- **Description**: Convert any input text to its "indoor voice", i.e., in lowercase.
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented a program that takes user input and outputs the text in lowercase.

## Task 2: Playback Speed
- **Description**: Introduce pauses in a sentence, similar to a slowed-down speech effect.
- **Outcome**: Developed a program that replaces spaces in user input with three periods (`...`).

## Task 3: Making Faces
- **Description**: Convert classic emoticons like `:)` and `:(` into their modern emoji counterparts.
- **Outcome**: Created a function that successfully converts specific emoticons to emojis in a given text.

## Task 4: Einstein
- **Description**: Calculate the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's \(E = mc^2\) equation.
- **Outcome**: Built a program that prompts for mass and outputs the equivalent energy in Joules.

## Task 5: Tip Calculator
- **Description**: Assist users in calculating the tip amount based on the total meal cost and desired tip percentage.
- **Outcome**: Developed a partially completed tip calculator, with functions to convert specific formatted strings to floats.

## Reflection
Week 1 provided a comprehensive introduction to Python's capabilities. I found the tasks engaging and it offered practical applications of the concepts learned. The Tip Calculator, in particular, presented an interesting challenge in string manipulation and conversion. Looking forward to diving deeper into more complex Python applications in the coming weeks.
