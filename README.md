# CS50 Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through Harvard University's CS50x and CS50P courses. 

- **CS50x** is an introduction to computer science and the art of programming, covering a wide range of topics from C to web development.
  
- **CS50P** delves deeper into programming, focusing on Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

Each course's folder contains weekly READMEs that summarize my experiences, the challenges I faced, and my reflections on the topics covered. These summaries provide insights into my learning process and the progression of the courses.

## Note on Academic Honesty
In accordance with the academic honesty policies of both courses, I have not uploaded any problem set solutions or code. The purpose of this repository is solely to share my experiences and reflections, not to provide answers or solutions to assignments. If you're currently taking CS50x, CS50P, or considering them, I encourage you to work through the problem sets on your own to get the most out of the courses.

## About the Courses
- **CS50x** is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It's a challenging but rewarding journey into the world of computational thinking and problem-solving.

- **CS50P** is an extension of CS50x, focusing on Python. It provides a deeper understanding of programming concepts using Python's intuitive syntax and vast library ecosystem.

## Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank the staff of both CS50x and CS50P, especially Professor David J. Malan, for creating such comprehensive and engaging courses. My journey through these courses has been transformative, and I'm grateful for the knowledge and skills I've gained along the way.
