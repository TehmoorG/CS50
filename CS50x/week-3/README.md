# Week 3: Algorithms

## Overview
Week 3 of CS50x introduces us to the world of algorithms. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. This week, we delve into sorting algorithms and their efficiencies, as well as explore algorithms in the context of real-world applications like voting systems.

### Task 1: Sort
**Description:** Implement a program that sorts an array of numbers. While there are many ways to sort numbers (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort), you are free to choose any method.  
**Outcome:** This problem set provides a hands-on experience with sorting algorithms. It emphasizes the importance of algorithm efficiency and gives a practical understanding of how different sorting methods compare.

### Task 2: Plurality
**Description:** Implement a program that runs a plurality election. In this election, every voter gets to vote for one candidate, and at the end of the election, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.  
**Outcome:** This problem set introduces the concept of `struct` in C and simulates a real-world voting system. It tests the ability to handle arrays of structs and emphasizes the importance of algorithmic efficiency in tallying votes.

### Task 3: Tideman
**Description:** Implement a program that runs a Tideman ranked-choice voting election. In this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference. The election then proceeds in a series of rounds where the least preferred candidate is eliminated until a winner is determined.  
**Outcome:** This is one of the more challenging problems, requiring a deep understanding of algorithms, structs, and arrays. It offers a comprehensive look into ranked-choice voting systems and the complexities involved in determining a winner.

## Reflection
Week 3 was a deep dive into the realm of algorithms. From sorting numbers to simulating complex voting systems, the challenges this week were both intellectually stimulating and immensely rewarding. The Tideman problem, in particular, was a testament to the power and complexity of algorithms in real-world applications. It was a week of significant learning and growth.# Week 3: Conditionals

## Overview
In Week 3, the emphasis was on understanding and implementing conditionals. Through a series of diverse challenges, the power of decision-making in code was explored, allowing for dynamic outcomes based on specific conditions.

## Task 1: camelCase
- **Description**: Convert a variable name from camel case to snake case. For instance, `firstName` should be converted to `first_name`.
  
## Task 2: Coke Machine
- **Description**: Simulate a vending machine that sells bottles of Coca-Cola for 50 cents. The machine only accepts coins in denominations of 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents. The program should guide the user through the process of inserting coins and inform them of the remaining amount due.

## Task 3: Just setting up my twttr
- **Description**: Implement a text shortener by omitting vowels from a given string. For example, "Twitter" would be shortened to "Twttr".

## Task 4: Vanity Plates
- **Description**: Validate a user-inputted vanity license plate based on specific requirements, such as starting with at least two letters and having a maximum of 6 characters. The program should determine if the input is valid or invalid based on the given rules.

## Task 5: Nutrition Facts
- **Description**: Provide nutrition information for various fruits. The user inputs the name of a fruit, and the program outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, based on data from the FDA.

## Reflection
Week 3 introduced the concept of conditionals, a fundamental aspect of programming. Through diverse challenges, from string manipulations to simulating real-world scenarios like a vending machine, the power and necessity of decision-making in code were evident. Each task provided a unique opportunity to apply and solidify understanding of conditionals.
