# Week 8: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview
Week 8 of CS50x introduces the foundational technologies behind web development: HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity. This week, we explore the intricacies of creating web pages, styling them, and adding dynamic functionality.

### Task 1: Homepage
**Description:** Design a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript. This page can be about anything, showcasing skills, interests, or anything else.  
**Outcome:** This problem set provides a hands-on experience with web development basics. It emphasizes the importance of structuring content with HTML, beautifying it with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

### Task 2: Trivia
**Description:** Implement a trivia quiz web application. Users should be able to answer questions and get feedback on their answers.  
**Outcome:** This problem set deepens the understanding of JavaScript and its interaction with HTML elements. It introduces concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time feedback to user actions.

## Reflection
Week 8 was a journey into the world of web development. Transitioning from backend languages to frontend technologies was both exciting and challenging. Designing the homepage was a creative process, allowing for personal expression and showcasing web design skills. The Trivia problem, on the other hand, was a testament to the power of JavaScript in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. This week was a significant step in understanding the vast landscape of web technologies.
