# Week 5: Data Structures

## Overview
Week 5 of CS50x introduces the concept of data structures. Data structures are fundamental in computer science as they provide ways to organize and store data efficiently. This week, we explore linked lists, trees, hash tables, tries, and more. We learn how to implement these structures in C and understand their advantages and limitations.

### Task 1: Inheritance
**Description:** Implement a program to simulate the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.  
**Outcome:** This problem set provides a hands-on experience with trees and recursive structures. It emphasizes the importance of understanding inheritance patterns and how data can be structured hierarchically.

### Task 2: Speller
**Description:** Implement a program that spell-checks a file, using a hash table.  
**Outcome:** This is one of the most challenging problems in CS50x. It tests the understanding of hash tables and their efficiency. Implementing the speller provides insights into how spell-checkers work and the importance of efficient data retrieval in large datasets.

## Reflection
Week 5 was a deep dive into the world of data structures. The challenges this week, especially the Speller problem, were intellectually stimulating. Implementing efficient data structures from scratch was both challenging and rewarding. The Inheritance problem provided a unique perspective on how data can be structured and retrieved in a hierarchical manner. Overall, this week was a significant milestone in understanding the core concepts of computer science.
