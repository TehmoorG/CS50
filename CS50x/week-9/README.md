# Week 9: Flask

## Overview
Week 9 of CS50x introduces Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. Flask allows for the creation of web applications with ease, integrating seamlessly with databases and offering a modular approach to web development. This week, we explore the intricacies of routing, templating, and integrating web forms with databases using Flask.

### Task 1: Finance
**Description:** Implement a web application via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks, a la the below, using real-time stock data.  
**Outcome:** This problem set provides a comprehensive understanding of integrating Flask with databases (like SQLite). It emphasizes the importance of user authentication, session management, and real-time data retrieval from third-party APIs.

### Task 2: Birthday
**Description:** Implement a website where users can submit their birthdays and check the birthdays of others.  
**Outcome:** This problem set introduces the basics of Flask forms and database integration. It showcases how to collect data from users, store it in a database, and retrieve it for display.

## Reflection
Week 9 was a deep dive into the world of Flask and web application development. The Finance problem was particularly challenging, integrating various components like real-time stock data, user authentication, and database operations. It was a testament to the power of Flask in creating complex web applications. The Birthday problem, on the other hand, was a great introduction to Flask forms and database operations, emphasizing the importance of user data collection and display. This week was a significant step in mastering web application development using Flask.
