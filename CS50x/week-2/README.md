# Week 2: Arrays

## Overview
Week 2 of CS50x delves into the concept of arrays in C. Arrays are fundamental data structures that allow us to store multiple values of the same type together. This week, we explore the intricacies of arrays and their applications in solving real-world problems.

### Task 1: Readability
**Description:** Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text using the Coleman-Liau index.  
**Outcome:** This problem set offers a comprehensive understanding of string manipulation and array operations in C. It also introduces the concept of mathematical formulas in programming and how to translate them into code.

### Task 2: Substitution
**Description:** Create a program that implements a substitution cipher. The program should take a key as a command-line argument and prompt the user for a string of plaintext. It should then output the ciphertext.  
**Outcome:** This problem set deepens the understanding of arrays and string manipulation. It also introduces the concept of ciphers and encryption, emphasizing the importance of data security and cryptography.

## Reflection
Week 2 was a journey into the world of arrays and their applications. The problems this week were more complex, requiring a deeper understanding of logic and string manipulation. Implementing the Coleman-Liau index in the Readability problem was a highlight, showcasing the power of programming in solving real-world problems. The Substitution problem was a fascinating introduction to the world of cryptography, highlighting the importance of data security in today's digital age.
