# Week 4: Memory

## Overview
Week 4 of CS50x delves into the intricacies of memory. Understanding how memory works is crucial in programming, especially in languages like C where manual memory management is required. This week, we explore the concepts of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and the challenges and rewards of working directly with memory.

### Task 1: Volume
**Description:** Implement a program that modifies the volume of an audio file. You will be given a buffer that contains samples of an audio file, and your task is to modify the volume of those samples.  
**Outcome:** This problem set provides a hands-on experience with buffers and bitwise operations. It emphasizes the importance of understanding memory and how data is stored in audio files.

### Task 2: Filter
**Description:** Implement a program that applies filters to BMPs, specifically grayscale, reflection, blur, and edge detection.  
**Outcome:** This problem set deepens the understanding of image processing and manipulation. It offers insights into how images are stored in memory and how different filters can be applied by manipulating pixel values.

### Task 3: Recover
**Description:** Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image. The challenge is to search through the forensic image and find the JPEGs, even though their headers might be fragmented throughout the file.  
**Outcome:** This is a challenging problem that tests the understanding of file I/O and memory management in C. It simulates a real-world scenario of data recovery and emphasizes the importance of understanding file formats and headers.

## Reflection
Week 4 was a journey into the depths of memory management and manipulation. The challenges this week, especially the Recover problem, were a testament to the complexities of working directly with memory. Understanding how data is stored, whether in audio files or images, and being able to manipulate it was both challenging and rewarding. This week was a significant step in mastering the intricacies of C programming.
