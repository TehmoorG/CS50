# Week 1: Introduction to C

## Overview
In the first week of CS50x, we are introduced to the C programming language. We begin by understanding the basic structure of a C program and gradually move on to more complex problems that test our understanding of algorithms and logic in C.

### Task 1: Hello
**Description:** Write a program in C that prompts the user for their name and then prints "hello, [name]".  
**Outcome:** Familiarity with user input in C using the `get_string` function and output using the `printf` function.

### Task 2: Mario
**Description:** There are two versions of this problem:  
- **More Comfortable:** Create a program that prints out a full pyramid of a specified height.  
**Outcome:** This problem set tests the understanding of loops and nested loops in C. It also challenges the student to think about the logic behind creating patterns using loops.

### Task 3: Credit
**Description:** Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm.  
**Outcome:** This problem set is a deep dive into understanding algorithms. It tests the student's ability to break down a problem into smaller tasks and implement a solution in C. It also provides experience with the `long long` data type and arithmetic operations in C.

## Reflection
Week 1 was both challenging and rewarding. Starting with a simple "Hello, World!" program and moving on to more complex problems like validating credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm was a significant leap. The Mario problem, in particular, was a great exercise in understanding loops and pattern logic.
